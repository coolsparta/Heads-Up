A fun, interactive game where players hold the phone to their forehead
and guess words based on teammatesâ€™ clues

The app uses the accelerometer of the phone to detect tilt.

To go to the next word in the deck tilt your phone at 45 degree angle.

You can create your own deck of words by clicking on the button "Create Your Own".

The user defined deck of words are stored in the temporary memory in form of ArrayList.
